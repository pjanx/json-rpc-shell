acid
====

`acid' is A Continuous Integration Daemon.  Currently under heavy development.

The aim of this project is to provide a dumbed-down alternative to Travis CI.
I find it way too complex to set up and run in a local setting, while the basic
gist of it is actually very simple -- run some stuff on new git commits.

`acid' will provide a JSON-RPC 2.0 service for frontends over FastCGI or SCGI,
as well as a webhook endpoint for notifications about new commits.

`acid' will be able to tell you about build results via e-mail and/or IRC.

Builds will only be supported on the same machine as the daemon.  Eventually I
might be able to add support for fully replicable builds using Docker.

With this being my own project, of course it is written in event-looped C99
where everything is stuffed into just a few files.  At least I hope it's written
in a somewhat clean manner.  Feel free to contribute.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, help2man, liberty (included)
Runtime dependencies: libev, Jansson

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/acid.git
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:
 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:
 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i acid-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix cpack with
`fakeroot' or file ownership will end up wrong.

Usage
-----
TODO.  The main application hasn't been written yet.
