json-rpc-shell
==============

`json-rpc-shell' is a simple shell for running JSON-RPC 2.0 queries.

This software has been created as a replacement for the following shell, which
is written in Java: http://software.dzhuvinov.com/json-rpc-2.0-shell.html

Supported transports
--------------------
 - HTTP
 - HTTPS
 - WebSocket
 - WebSocket over TLS

WebSockets
----------
The WebSocket transport is rather experimental.  As the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec
doesn't say almost anything about the underlying transports, I'll shortly
describe the way it's implemented: every request is sent as a single text
message.  If it has an "id" field, i.e. it's not just a notification, the
client waits for a message from the server in response.

There's no support so far for any protocol extensions, nor for specifying
the higher-level protocol (the "Sec-Ws-Protocol" HTTP field).

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, help2man,
                    liberty (included), http-parser (included)
Runtime dependencies: libev, Jansson, cURL, readline, openssl

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/json-rpc-shell.git
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:
 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:
 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i json-rpc-shell-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix cpack with
`fakeroot' or file ownership will end up wrong.

Run the program with `--help' to obtain usage information.
